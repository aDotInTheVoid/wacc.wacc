NOTES ON WRITING WACC
---------------------

char[] to string is allowed, but not the other way around, you you
almost always want to use char[]

EXTENSIONS
----------

The goal of this project is to be written in as close to "vanilla" as possible.
It does not make use of extensions for structs, or more conventiant expressions.
Instead, these are achived with code generation in python, and extensive use of
preprocessor macros.

However, to read the a file, it is nessesary to use an extension, as vanilla WACC
does not support reading strings, and reading chars requires a newline. Currently
this is done with the "extern" extension [0]. Even so, we only use getchar(3), so 
it should be easy to port to different IO extensions.
